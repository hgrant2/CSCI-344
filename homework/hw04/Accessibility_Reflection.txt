1. Accessibility is important to all users. It is vitial for people who may be color blind,
someone who might only be able to use a keyboard, or someone who can't read. Using Accessibility 
features makes your site more widely avaliable to all. A way to make instagram more accessible is
by using a screen reader for those who can't read. 

2. I use WAVE to check if there is anything wrong.

3. Once you are more used to making things accessible it isn't very hard to male it work. 
for example, just simply using a button makes things tabbable which is accessible on the keyboard.
Making things accessible makes sites easier to use for all users because you can access the site in 
anyway you want.
